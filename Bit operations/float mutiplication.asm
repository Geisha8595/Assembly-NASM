; Write an assembly program to perform a product of 2 float values
; using integer arithmetic and bit operations. Start with 2 float values
; in memory and store the product in memory
;
; This program doesn't handle arithmetic operations which result in NaN except operations
; where NaNs are involved or when the operations overflows/underflows. Operations which
; involve infinity will have unexpected results.

; I haven't tested this program thoroughly

          ; 2 types of NaNs, namely QNaN "Quiet Not a Number" and SNaN "Signaling Not a Number". QNaN denotes 
          ; results that aren't mathematically defined e.g. 0/0, inf - inf, sqrt(-1) whereas SNaN denotes 
          ; results that resulted from computations where an overflow or floating point underflow occured. 
          ; QNaN and SNaN are distinguished from each other by specific fraction fields. In a QNaN the most 
          ; significant bit in the fraction field is 0 and the rest of the fraction field consists of at least

          ; of any combination of 1s and 0s. Operations involving NaN lead to QNaN as result. As a side note;
