; p.60 exercise 1.
;
; Write an assembly language program to compute the distance squared
; between 2 points in the plane identified as 2 integer coordinates
; each, stored in memory.
;
; Remember the Pythagorean Theorem!
;
; Here we need to pick the rigth sized registers carefully so that we don't end up
; in a situation where the registers meant for storing the results are too small.
; After multiplication the bit length of the product will max(a,b) at least or
; a+b at most where a and b are the bit lengths of the factors in binary. In this
; case a and b are equal. Imul instruction is used for signed multiplication whereas
; mul is used for unsigned multiplication. Imul is also more flexible than mul since
; it allows you the choose which registers to use for the multiplication.
;
; There might be exercises where I've mistakenly used imul instead of mul.
