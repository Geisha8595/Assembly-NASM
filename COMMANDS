TERMINAL COMMANDS

COMPILE:

nasm -felf64 name>.asm -g -F dwarf -l <listing file name>.lst -o <object name>.o
(adds debuging info into the object file and outputs listing file)

- Debugging info is neded for debugging
- Listing file includes goodies such as addresses or offsets of instructions (2 column)
  and instructions in hex format (3 column).

LINK:

ld <object name>.o -o <executable name>  (no additional library)
gcc <object name>.o -o <executable name> (linking libc library)

EXECUTE:

./<exectutable name>

DEBUG:

gdb <executable name> (start debugging)

break <file name>.asm:<line number> (conventional breakpoint)

break <label name> e.g. _start (conventional breakpoint)

break <file name>.asm:<line number> if <register> == <value>
(conditional breakpoint)

run (will run to breakpoint or end of program)

record (allows the use of rni and rsi commands, cannot be used before run command)

ni (next instruction)

rni (previous instruction, cannot be used before record command)

si (step into next instruction inside function, do not use with c functions!)

rsi (previous instruction inside function, cannot be used before record command)

jump <label name> (e.g. start over: jump _start or main)

i r <register> (prints register value in decimal)

p/t $<register> (prints register value in binary)

info registers (prints all registers)

p(declared type)<memory location name> (prints memory location)
length = declared type
byte = char
word (2 byte) = short int
doubleword (4 byte) = int
quadword (8 byte) = long int

x /[length][format][address expression] (prints memory content pointed by address in register)
length = number of elements
format = o (octal), x (hexadecimal), d (decimal), u (unsigned decimal), t (binary), f (floating point),
         a (address), c (char), s (string), i (instruction), b (byte), h (halfword), w (word), g (giant word)
address = the register where the address is stored in e.g. $rsi

p (<declared type>[n])<array name> (prints elements in array up to nth element starting from 1)

info registers eflags (prints status flags that are set/raised)

shell clear (clears the screen)

q (quits debugger)

OTHER:

echo $? (displays return value, rdi (no libc) rax (libc))
